Vim theme: relaxed
==================
Last modification on 2011-01-07

This theme was made by [Hiltjo Posthuma][Hiltjo] which he published on his
website [codemadness.org][CodeMadness] in [this post][Post]. This repository is
only made to ease it's installation (using plugin managers such as
[vim-Plug][Plug]).

Here is an exerpt from the post he made about it:

    This is a dark theme I made for vim. This is a theme I personally used for
    quite a while now and over time tweaked to my liking. It is made for gvim, but
    also works for 16-colour terminals (with small visual differences). The
    relaxed.vim file also has my .Xdefaults file colours listed at the top for
    16+-colour terminals on X11.

    It is inspired by the "desert" theme available at
    https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=105, although I removed the
    cursive and bold styles and changed some colours I didn't like.
